Hi Casetabs team,

For challenges #1 and #2, I sure hope you guys have a sense of humor.

As for the Rails application,

Requirements, in order of importance:

- [x] Uses the Twitter API
- [x] Visiting the home page defaults to a user page with the last 20 tweets from @casetabs
- [x] Any @name in a tweet should link to a user page, also with the last 20 tweets for that user
- [ ] Cache identical twitter API calls for 5 minutes.
- [ ] Hovering over any @names in tweets will bring up a modal/tooltip giving a description of that user (# tweets, # of followers)
Any additional styling or improvements to the user experience are a plus.
- [ ] Bonus: Host the app on the free tier of AWS.
